This program is used to create 3 processes using fork system call in for loop and display their Parent PID and their own PID
This program was written by me(Madhur Jodhwani) on 5th October 2020.
These programs are Linux specific and I used Ubuntu Linux 20.04 to execute them and can be used by you for modification or making copy and distribution of it.
Thank You.
