These programs demonstrate the internal concept of pipe in the LINUX OS
Here we use a buffer array and write inside it from write file
and read inside the buffer from the read file,once we write we unlink the fifo
We have to tell the read file about the location of the buffer and the read file reads from the buffer.
then we close the fifo and exit
