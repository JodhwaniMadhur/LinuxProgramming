This is a C program that i have made to read a directory contents 
and takes instructions strictly through command line arguments and returns the contents of the directory on to the terminal.
This program uses functions such as opendir() to open the directory that is specified by th user and then readir() is used in loop 
to return the contents of directory and print it on terminal.
These programs are Linux specific and I used Ubuntu Linux 18.04 to execute them and can be used by you for modification or making copy and distribution of it.
Thank You.
